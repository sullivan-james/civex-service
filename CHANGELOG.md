# Changelog

One section per tagged release: `## vX.Y.Z — <label> (YYYY-MM-DD)`. Every
`v*` tag must have a matching entry here *before* the tag is pushed —
`.github/workflows/release.yml` fails the release job if it's missing (see
PRODUCTION_READINESS.md §4a). The version itself has one source of truth,
the git tag (resolved via setuptools-scm into `civex.__version__`); this
file is release notes, not a second place to track the number.

Within a release, put breaking or migration-relevant changes under their
own `### Breaking` heading first — schema/DB migration changes (see
PRODUCTION_READINESS.md item 1) always belong there, even when handled
automatically, since that's what someone upgrading needs to scan for.

v0.0.1 through v1.0.3 were tagged and released without this discipline in
place. Rather than leave the changelog's most recent entry frozen at
v0.0.3 while nineteen undocumented tags shipped past it on PyPI, v1.0.4
below is a single retroactively-written entry consolidating everything
that shipped across that whole range — not nineteen fabricated
per-tag entries reconstructed after the fact. Discipline applies starting
from the next tag forward.

## v1.0.4 (2026-07-16)

Consolidated summary of everything shipped since the original v0.0.3
alpha release (see `git log v0.0.3..v1.0.4` for the raw commit history).
Despite the version number, this is still an alpha release — see
PRODUCTION_READINESS.md for what's blocking a real 1.0.

### Breaking
- `civex dataset` CLI command renamed to `civex collection` (underlying
  service/module names are unchanged; update any scripts that call
  `civex dataset ...` directly).
- License changed from the original "Civex Freeware License" to a new
  "Civex Software License Agreement" — review terms before upgrading.

### Features
- **AI assistant** — `civex ai` configures a provider (Anthropic, Groq,
  Gemini, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint); a chat panel in the
  web UI can inspect and act on schemas/datasets/records via tool calls.
- **Desktop app** — `civex-desktop` packages civex as a native tray
  application (PyInstaller, cross-platform builds attached to GitHub
  releases), with open/recent-project UI and local file logging.
- **Database migrations** — Alembic-managed schema migrations
  (`src/civex/db/migrations/`), applied automatically on connect;
  `civex db current` / `civex db migrate` for manual control.
- **Structured logging & telemetry** — structlog-based JSON logging with
  secret redaction, and opt-in Sentry error telemetry.
- **Local server hardening** — `LocalGuardMiddleware` adds DNS-rebinding
  and CSRF defenses to the loopback-only dev server.
- **CivexHub remote sync** — SSH transport, multi-volume support, and UI
  parity for pushing/pulling to a bare civex repository. (CivexHub was
  later split out of this repo entirely — see CIVEX-13 — so this is the
  last entry here that touches it.)

### Fixes
- Creating a schema with a duplicate name no longer fails incorrectly.
- Plugin/workflow restore silently returning 0 on Windows.
- Various remote sync fixes.
- Terminal router now guarded behind a Unix platform check (it didn't
  work on Windows).
- Frontend build reliability in CI (esbuild `ETXTBSY` on Linux, a
  cross-platform shell for the build step).

### Other
- Expanded automated test suite (~32% coverage, CI-gated at 30% — see
  `tests/README.md`).

### Installation
See [README.md](README.md) for `pipx` install instructions.
